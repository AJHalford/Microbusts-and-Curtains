abstract = {Describing the properties of short time constant impulsive electron precipitation in the auroral zone, Anderson and Milton [1964] found that the time interval between microbursts was nonrandom although power spectrum analysis revealed only a weak tendency toward periodicity at 0.6 second. It was thought that intrinsically this phenomenon might exhibit stronger periodicities but that they might not have appeared, owing to limitations in the experimental methods. A suspected difficulty was the use of omnidirectional detectors. Thus if several independent source regions were present differing in periodic behavior the peaks in the power spectrum could be washed out.},
